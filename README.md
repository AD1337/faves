# Faves 1.0 - ![Godot v3.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/godot-v3.4-%23478cbf)

A better implementation of the Favorites feature in Godot.

## :muscle: Features

* A dock that sits in your Godot Editor and allows you to drag your favorite files into it.
* Multiple favorites lists; you can have one for the player, one for UI, one for enemies, etc.
* Add tasks to your favorite files. This works like a to-do list for each script, scene or resource.
